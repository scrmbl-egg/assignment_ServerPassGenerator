# ServerPassGenerator
This small project is a class assignment where I was tasked with making two console applications in one project: one representing the client, and the other representing the server.
The client connects to the server and is asked a couple of questions about the password that will be generated, and once all the requirements are confirmed, a password is given to the client by the server.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some of the code's classes, variables and functions are written in Spanish :es:, as it was imperative to name said elements as the assignment originally instructed.
